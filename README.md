## Design

### 1. Colour Scheme
* A very light blue - rgba(225, 254, 251, 1) has been used as the main background color for the Navbar, Footer & background as blues can be associated with the crystal clear waters at beaches in the Philippines. 
* The buttons have various colours which match the icon colors which help make it clearly identifable which icon category is associated with each button. Food & drink button - rgba(245, 161, 97, 1), Hostel button - rgba(130, 228, 211, 1);, attractions button - rgba(212, 173, 222, 1); These colors have also been selected so the black text is easy to read.
* The google maps api color scheme of atlas has been selected as it ties in nicely with the light blue background color.
* Icons on the map are slightly darker versions of the button colors so they are easily visble on the map.
* Text is either black or white across the webpage depending on background color.
